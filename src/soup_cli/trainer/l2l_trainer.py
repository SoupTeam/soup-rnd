"""SFT trainer mode for L2L (``training.l2l``, ADR 0002).

HF's loop prefetches ``gradient_accumulation_steps`` batches per optimizer step
(``Trainer.get_batch_samples``) and then calls ``training_step`` once per batch. The
subclass keeps that loop and everything it owns (``num_items_in_batch``, lr schedule,
logging, checkpoints, resume) and changes two calls:

* ``get_batch_samples`` remembers the window of k batches HF just built;
* ``training_step`` runs one layer-major step over the whole window on the window's
  first call and returns the summed loss. The other k-1 calls of the window return a
  zero and compute nothing, so HF's accumulation of the returned losses and its one
  optimizer step per window stay as they are.

Each micro-batch runs at its own length, as in gradient accumulation: nothing is padded.
The layer arguments (position ids, mask) are captured once per distinct shape and each
micro-batch gets the call of its shape. The activation store sizes every micro-batch's
chunks to that micro-batch, so a short row does not pay for the longest row of its window.

FP8 is an opt-in boundary codec: capacities retain the logical hidden width for
per-token scales, and the host lease includes codec scratch, not device workspace.
It is lossy and does not relax the routing guard. An already-resolved memory plan
can bound each window; the trainer never selects k or changes HF's schedule.

Each micro-batch position keeps its largest capacity seen so far. A larger window grows
the store after releasing its old allocations. When the store does not fit the host-RAM
budget, the lowest layers spill to one file (``soup_cli.utils.l2l_spill``); ``train`` removes
it on every exit it sees and sweeps files of dead runs at start.
