## Validation split & evaluation (`training.eval_steps`)

`data.val_split` (default `0.1`) holds that share of the rows out of training,
and the run evaluates them:

```yaml
data:
  val_split: 0.1    # the default
training:
  eval_steps: 50    # optional; unset = evaluate at the end of every epoch
```

- **Default: every epoch.** At the end of each epoch the trainer runs one pass
  over the validation split and records `eval_loss`. It shows up as the **Val
  loss** row on the live panel, is stored as `val_loss` in the run's metrics in
  the experiment tracker, and is streamed as `TrainEvent.val_loss` to the Web UI.
  The pass is a forward over the held-out rows, a few percent of the run at the
  default split.
- **`training.eval_steps: N`** evaluates every N optimizer steps instead,
  counted after gradient accumulation like `save_steps`. The last step is
  evaluated too when it is not a multiple of N, so a value larger than the run
  still evaluates once.
- **Batch size.** The evaluation runs at the resolved per-device train batch
  (after `batch_size: auto`), not Hugging Face's default of 8, so a card sized
  to train fits the evaluation too. Layer-streamed runs (`stream_layers: true`)
  evaluate the same way, streaming the frozen layers as a training step does.
- **`val_split: 0`** trains on every row and evaluates nothing, unless the data
  brings its own validation split: an HF-hub dataset's `validation` split, or a
  pre-tokenized cache's `val` / `validation` split.

**Generation-based tasks (`grpo`, `ppo`, `online_dpo`).** Evaluating them means
generating completions, which costs about as much per row as training on it. So
they do not evaluate by default, and they do not withhold rows either:
`data.val_split` is ignored, every row trains, and the run prints a one-line note
saying so. On `grpo`, set `training.eval_steps` to hold the split out and
evaluate it; TRL generates completions for the held-out prompts and logs
`eval_loss` with the evaluation rewards. On `grpo` that `eval_loss` (the Val
loss row and the tracker's `val_loss`) is TRL's policy objective on the
held-out completions, not a likelihood: advantages are normalised within each
group, so it stays near zero, can be negative, and does not measure held-out
quality. The held-out reward is `eval_reward`, in the `log_history` of each
checkpoint's `trainer_state.json`. TRL needs whole groups of
`num_generations` completions in an evaluation batch, so `grpo` evaluates at the
largest multiple of `num_generations` that fits in the train batch, and says so
when that differs from the train batch. The evaluation's rewards never reach the
reward-hack detector, the mitigation controller or the echo-trap detector: they
read training generations only. `ppo` and `online_dpo` refuse
`training.eval_steps`: TRL's PPO loop never calls `evaluate()`, and online DPO's
`evaluate()` crashes on prompt-only rows. A generation-based evaluation for
those two is a separate feature.

**Refused at config load.** `training.eval_steps` on `backend: mlx` (mlx-lm
evaluates the split on its own cadence, #739), on `task: unlearn` (it trains on
`forget_set` / `retain_set` and has no validation split), and with
`val_split: 0` on local files or remote URIs, where there would be nothing to
evaluate.

**Evaluated but not tracked: `prm` and `moe_lora_routing`.** They attach no live
training callback (#802), so their `eval_loss` reaches the trainer's log history
and not the experiment tracker.

Until #1223 no trainer on the transformers backend scheduled an evaluation: the
default split was held out of training and never used, and `val_loss` stayed
empty.

---

## Seeds & reproducibility (`training.seed`)

Two knobs, both unset by default:

```yaml
training:
  seed: 1234        # weight init of new params, data order, dropout
  data_seed: 99     # optional — data order ONLY, so init stays fixed
```

`seed` reaches `TrainingArguments.seed` (which `Trainer.__init__` hands to
`transformers.set_seed`, covering `random`, `numpy` and `torch`) and the
multipack FFD sampler. `data_seed` reaches `TrainingArguments.data_seed`; set it
alongside `seed` to vary only the order rows are seen in while holding
initialisation fixed.

**Why you want this.** Without a seed knob every run of a config took the same
default, so "run it again with a different seed" was impossible: replicates of
one arm differed only by row permutation and GPU nondeterminism. That understates
run-to-run spread, and spread is the yardstick a real between-arm difference has
to beat. Three replicates at three seeds is the cheapest honest error bar you can
put on a training change. Create one config per replicate so the seed and its
output directory stay together in the recorded recipe:

```yaml
# soup-seed-1.yaml (repeat for seeds 2 and 3)
training:
  seed: 1
output: runs/seed-1
```

```bash
for s in 1 2 3; do
  soup train --config "soup-seed-$s.yaml" && echo "seed $s done"
done
```

**"Unset" does not mean the same thing for both fields.** An unset `seed`
resolves to 42, HuggingFace's own `TrainingArguments` default. An unset
`data_seed` stays `None`, which HF reads as "follow `seed`" rather than as a
seed of its own, so leaving it out is not the same kind of default as leaving
`seed` out. The multipack sampler still gets `0`, the value it has had since
v0.37.0. The fields are `Optional[int]` rather than defaulting to 42 precisely
so the trainer can tell "unset" from "explicitly 42" and keep those different
historical defaults intact.

**What changes for a run that sets neither field.** The values it trains at are
the same as before: seed 42, `data_seed` at `None`. What is new is *when* the
seed arrives. Before #353 nothing called `set_seed` ahead of `get_peft_model`,
so `lora_A` and any freshly initialised classification head were drawn from
torch's default generator, which is seeded from entropy once per process. An
unseeded run's initialisation therefore varied from one process to the next, and
it is now deterministic at 42. If you were getting replicate spread out of runs
that set no seed, that is where it was coming from: those runs are identical to
each other now, and varying a replicate means setting `training.seed` on
purpose.

Bounds: `[0, 2**32 - 1]` (`set_seed` feeds `numpy.random.seed`, which rejects
anything outside that range), `0` is a legitimate seed, and a YAML `true` is
rejected rather than silently becoming seed 1. `data_seed` is forwarded to
Accelerate's dataloader configuration and needs `accelerate >= 1.1.0`;
below that, transformers warns and ignores it (`seed` is unaffected).

**Scope.** Every task wrapper threads both fields into the `TrainingArguments`
subclass it builds, and applies `seed` before it loads the model, so the LoRA
adapter and any freshly initialised head are drawn at the configured seed rather
than at whatever the process happened to be sitting on (#353). `unlearn` builds
no `Trainer` at all, and its RMU control vector follows `training.seed` too,
staying at 0 when the seed is unset. The `pretrain` and layer-streaming paths
pick `seed` up for their samplers as well.

Through v0.73.0 this reached the **SFT** trainer only, so `training.seed: 7` on
a DPO or GRPO run was accepted and silently trained at 42.

The one path that still ignores both fields is the **MLX backend**
(`backend: mlx`), whose trainers seed nothing at all — MLX has its own RNG
(`mx.random`). Setting either field there now prints a warning naming it
(`MLX backend ignores: training.seed ...`) rather than accepting it in silence,
so an MLX run cannot look seeded while it is not.

**Not a determinism guarantee.** A fixed seed makes the *software* RNG
reproducible. It does not make CUDA kernels bit-reproducible — non-deterministic
atomics, autotuned algorithms and a different GPU or library version can still
move the last digits. For bit-exact reruns you also need
`torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`, which Soup does not set for you.

---

## Rewind — which row spiked the loss (`soup rewind`)

While an SFT run trains, Soup writes `<output>/rewind.jsonl`: one line per micro-batch
with the dataset rows in it, each row's mean supervised-token loss, and its
supervised-token count. When the loss jumps, `soup rewind` reads that file and names
the rows that carried the step. It needs no model or GPU, and runs in seconds.

```yaml
training:
  rewind_log: true   # default; set false to write nothing
```

```bash
soup rewind                      # most recent run: list spikes, detail the worst
soup rewind <run_id> --step 340  # rank the rows of one step
soup rewind <run_id> --top 25    # how many rows to list (default 10)
soup rewind <run_id> --json r.json --no-preview
```

A spike is a step whose loss is non-finite, or more than 2x the median of the previous
20 measured steps. Rows are ranked by their share of the step's summed token loss, so
one long, badly-formed row stands out even when its per-token mean is ordinary. Example
output (illustrative numbers):

```text
                Step 340 rows
 Row    Loss   Tokens   Share  Preview
  91  6.8120    3,900   94.1%  iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAJYCAYAAAC…
  12  1.1034      212    0.8%  Sure — here is a summary of the article…
row 91: 94% of step 340's loss, 3,900 tokens
Inspect or drop this row, then retrain.
```

Scope: task `sft` on the transformers and MLX backends, single process, on the plain
text path. The recorder turns itself off, with one warning naming the reason, for
resumed runs, `packing` / `padding_free`, multipack, vision, audio, a pre-tokenised
dataset, and anything else it cannot attribute row by row. Previews are shown only when
the dataset on disk still matches the one the run trained on.

**What it costs.** Writing one line per micro-batch measured under 0.1 ms per
micro-batch, which is negligible against any real step, and a run's peak memory was
unchanged with the recorder on and off. The file grows without a cap: roughly 14 MB per
50,000 micro-batches at batch 8, or about 100 MB for a million rows over three epochs.
Delete it, or set `rewind_log: false`, if that matters to you.

**What it contains.** Integer row indices, one loss and one token count per row — never
any text from your dataset. Previews in `soup rewind` are rebuilt at read time from your
own data file, and only while its fingerprint still matches. The indices and token counts
are still weak metadata about a private dataset, so treat the file as you would the
`output` directory it sits in.

---

## Full fine-tuning (`lora.r: 0`)

Train every parameter, no adapter:

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: sft
training:
  quantization: none    # full-FT trains float weights
  lora:
    r: 0                # <- no adapter; the base itself trains
```

`lora.r: 0` is the supported spelling for plain full fine-tuning. It is the one
`soup`'s classifier trainer has read as "no adapter" since v0.71.12, and the one
`soup card` already resolves to a dense model rather than an adapter — so the
model card, the registry entry and the trainer all agree without extra flags. On
a rank of 0 the SFT trainer skips `get_peft_model` entirely: `soup train` prints
`Full fine-tuning: N parameter tensor(s) trainable (lora.r=0, no adapter)`
instead of `LoRA applied`, and the output directory holds a complete model, not
an adapter to merge.

Requirements, each rejected at config load with the reason named:
`task: sft`, `backend: transformers`, `modality: text`, and
`quantization: none` (quantized weights cannot be trained directly — use LoRA
on top of them, i.e. QLoRA). It is mutually exclusive with every LoRA feature
(`use_dora` / `use_vera` / `use_olora` / `use_rslora` / `rank_pattern` /
`alpha_pattern` / `init_strategy` / `moe_lora` / `use_longlora` /
`relora_steps` / `loraplus_lr_ratio`) — a LoRA knob next to `r: 0` is a
contradiction rather than something to silently ignore — and with the other two
"LoRA off" modes, [Spectrum](#spectrum--targeted-training-on-layer-snr-soup-spectrum-scan-v07123)
(`unfrozen_parameters`) and LISA (`lisa_enabled`), since each independently
decides what trains. It cannot be combined with layer streaming: streaming keeps
the decoder on the meta device and trains only the adapter, so there would be
nothing to full fine-tune.

`freeze_layers` / `freeze_ratio` **do** stay legal with `r: 0` — "train
everything above layer N" is a real technique — and the trainer respects
whatever they froze instead of silently unfreezing it. If they leave nothing
trainable the run is refused rather than burning GPU-hours on a no-op.

Pick between the three "LoRA off" modes by how much you want to train:

| Spelling | Trains | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lora.r: 0` | everything | you have the VRAM and want the strongest baseline |
| `unfrozen_parameters` ([Spectrum](#spectrum--targeted-training-on-layer-snr-soup-spectrum-scan-v07123)) | a hand-picked / SNR-ranked set | you want full-FT quality on the layers that matter |
| `lisa_enabled` (LISA) | a rotating random subset | you want full-FT quality at LoRA-like memory |

> Full fine-tuning needs far more memory than LoRA: optimizer state alone is
> ~8 bytes per parameter for AdamW. `batch_size: "auto"` estimates memory from
> a LoRA-shaped model, so on a full-FT run it errs optimistic — set
> `batch_size` explicitly, or start low and raise it. (This is not new to
> `r: 0`; the same is true of the Spectrum and LISA full-FT paths.)

**Load dtype** (#339, #471, #492): a frozen base — LoRA, or QLoRA — loads at
the checkpoint's own dtype (`torch_dtype="auto"`) instead of always upcasting to fp32,
since the base never receives an optimizer step. Measured on an H100,
Llama-3.1-8B, LoRA: 48,241 MiB peak -> 18,658 MiB, a 28.9 GB / 2.59x saving.
On a pre-Ampere CUDA card (T4 / P100 / V100 / GTX 16xx / RTX 20xx), `"auto"`
would give bf16 storage while training compute correctly stays fp16 — the
same card question `_resolve_mixed_precision` already asks — so the frozen
base explicitly loads `torch.float16` there instead. All three "LoRA off"
modes above (`lora.r: 0`, `unfrozen_parameters`, `lisa_enabled`) are the
trainable-base case and explicitly load `torch.float32` master weights
instead — a deliberate precision choice for the parameters an optimizer
actually steps, not an accidental upcast, and unaffected by the card check
above.

---

## Which tasks apply `training.quantization`

`quantization` defaults to `4bit`, but not every trainer reads it. These eight load the base
(and, for `distill`, the teacher) unquantised whatever the field says; `prm` loads it as fp32
master weights (see [Process Reward Model](#process-reward-model-prm)):

| task | quantization | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `distill` | `none` only | student and frozen teacher both load unquantised |
| `classifier`, `reranker`, `cross_encoder` | `none` only | full fine-tune unless `classifier_lora: true` |
| `prm` | `none` only | always a full fine-tune; a `lora` block is refused (`lora.r: 0` is allowed) |
| `moe_lora_routing` | `none` only | base frozen, only the router trains |
| `unlearn` | `none` only | policy and reference copy both load unquantised |
| `asr` | `none` only | full fine-tune unless `asr_lora: true` |

For these tasks an unset `quantization` resolves to `none`, so the stored config and the VRAM
pre-flight describe the run that actually happens (#795).

An explicit `4bit` or `8bit` (or `load_in_8bit: true`) **loads with a warning and resolves to
`none`**, because every config Soup dumped while `4bit` was the default carries it literally.
The warning names the task and the release that will refuse it; set `quantization: none` to
silence it. A Quant Menu value (`gptq`, `awq`, ...) or a 4-bit-only setting such as
`bnb_4bit_quant_storage` is refused at config load, naming the task. Every other task applies
the field as documented in [Performance & Quantization](performance-and-quantization.md).

---

## Continual-learning rehearsal (`--replay`)

Fine-tuning on a new task can erase the old one. Rehearsal is the standard
defence: mix a slice of the old data back in.

```bash
soup train --config new_task.yaml --replay old_task.jsonl --replay-ratio 0.1
```

or in `soup.yaml`:

```yaml
data:
  train: new_task.jsonl
  replay: old_task.jsonl
  replay_ratio: 0.1      # fraction of the FINAL mixed set
  replay_seed: 0
```

**The ratio is a share of the final set**, not of the new data:
`n_replay = round(r/(1-r) · n_new)`. At `0.1` over 1000 new rows that is 111
replay rows → 1111 total → exactly 10%. The console reports what it did:

```
Replay: +26 old rows interleaved (30.2% of 86)
```

Three guarantees worth knowing:

- **Interleaved, never appended.** A trailing block of old rows would mean the
  model sees them all in the final steps — a second mini-finetune, which is the
  failure rehearsal exists to prevent.
- **`train` only; validation stays pure new-task**, so your eval still measures
  the task you are learning. Measure old-task retention separately with
  `soup eval custom` / `soup ship`.
- **An undersized pool reports a shortfall rather than repeating rows** — a row
  seen twice per epoch is a different experiment.

The replay file gets its own format detection, so the old set may be alpaca while
the new one is sharegpt.

**Scope (v1):** `sft` and `pretrain` only, and incompatible with
`packing`/`multipack` — those concatenate rows into fixed blocks, so the ratio
stops being meaningful at block boundaries. Both are rejected with a clear error
rather than silently mis-mixing.

**Honest result.** Validated at proof-of-mechanism scale (SmolLM2-135M + LoRA):
training task B from a model that knew task A, replay retained A **7% better than
a no-replay control** (loss 0.565 → 0.526) at a ~5% cost to task B — the expected
trade. But forgetting without replay was only **+4%**, i.e. mild: LoRA on a 135M
model barely drifts. The direction and the mechanism are proven; the effect size
at full fine-tuning or 7B+ is unproven on a 4 GB box.

## Loop Hardening

Six surfaces protect the training loop from the failure modes that cost a real GPU-hour. The schema + math kernels shipped in v0.70.0; the live trainer-callback wiring shipped in **v0.71.11**, validated end-to-end on SmolLM2-135M.

`training.echo_trap_tokenizer_aware` (also available as the real
`--echo-trap-tokenizer-aware` option) switches echo-trap n-grams from
whitespace tokens to the active tokenizer's integer ids. This catches subword
repetition that punctuation-heavy decoded text can hide, but the score becomes
tokenizer-specific rather than vocabulary-agnostic.

### Closed-loop reward-hacking auto-mitigation (v0.71.26)

The detectors above *halt*; `training.reward_hack_mitigation` (or the `--reward-hack-mitigation` flag) makes the trainer *self-correct* mid-run. It requires `reward_hack_detector` on a `grpo` transformers run, and has four modes:

- **`log_only`** — observe only. Appends a per-step `mitigation_log.jsonl` under the run's output dir (the InfoRM/ensemble drop, the OK/WARN/HACK verdict, reward mean/std, completion-length trend, repetition) and provably never mutates β. Run this first to *see* hacking before you let a controller act on it.
- **`kl_control`** — a reversible **bang-bang + hysteresis** controller. When a multi-signal vote (`reward_hack_signals`: the detector drop + `length_trend` + `repetition`) stays above `reward_hack_trip_band` for `reward_hack_dwell_steps`, it multiplies β by `reward_hack_kl_gain` (clamped to `[reward_hack_beta_floor > 0, reward_hack_beta_ceil]`, never crossing 0); after `reward_hack_release_patience` below-band steps it relaxes β back toward the floor. Dwell + release-patience stop it flapping. β is written to **both** `trainer.beta` and `trainer.args.beta` so it takes effect on stock GRPO *and* Soup's GRPO variants (and `trainer.args.kl_coef` on PPO).
- **`pid_lagrangian`** — a **PID-Lagrangian** controller (Stooke et al. 2020) that holds the hacking signal at `reward_hack_signal_target` (Kp/Ki/Kd with integral anti-windup via `reward_hack_integral_clamp`), plus an **escalation ladder**: raise β → after `reward_hack_rollback_patience` persistent-HACK steps roll back to the last-good RL checkpoint (needs `rl_checkpoint_save_every_steps`) → after `reward_hack_max_recovery_attempts` rollbacks, early-stop with a plain-English give-up explanation.
- **Anti-gaming hardening** (any control mode): `reward_hack_signal_smoothing` (`ema`/`median` over `reward_hack_smoothing_window`), `reward_hack_conservative_on_disagreement` (when detectors disagree, keep KL high + guard against a bimodal reward-distribution collapse), and `reward_hack_reward_shaping` (subtract a bounded `reward_hack_shaping_strength` penalty on the gamed proxy — `length`/`repetition`/`sentinel` — over the reward-fn seam).

**Scope:** proof-of-mechanism only. Validated on SmolLM2-135M + a synthetic length-hacking task on a single RTX 3050 (all four modes live, including a real mid-run rollback). The on-GPU proof is GRPO-only. **On `task: ppo` the reward-hacking and echo-trap flags are refused** (`reward_hack_detector`, `reward_hack_mitigation`, `echo_trap_enabled`): the trl PPO trainer this build supports takes no reward functions, so the reward/completion signal those callbacks read is never captured, and a run carrying them would be announced and then inert. Whether the loop suppresses hacking without collapsing true reward on 7B+ with a real reward model is an open, community-validatable question. `reward_hack_mitigation ∈ {kl_control, pid_lagrangian}` is mutually exclusive with `ref_model_ema_alpha` (both drive the KL/ref dynamics).

Every detector composes with v0.34 `soup why` (anomaly explainer), v0.32 spike recovery, and the v0.53.11 #127 `GRPOStabilityCallback` so a single GRPO run can have InfoRM + echo-trap + spike-recovery + in-place ref-model EMA all active simultaneously without duplicating trajectory / state collection. The reward-hack and echo-trap callbacks read the per-step rewards through a shared, thread-safe capture buffer (Soup wraps your reward functions so it never has to monkeypatch TRL); `rm_ensemble` needs ≥2 reward functions to compute a divergence. The MiniLLM teacher-mix is an offline distribution-blend analog of the paper's on-policy teacher-mixed *sampling*, and ULD compares the distributions after clamping teacher ids to the teacher vocab (correct for same-family / extended-vocab pairs; a genuinely different tokenization needs a sequence-alignment step). The reference-model EMA (`--ref-model-ema-alpha`) updates in place — no full `state_dict` round-trip — so it is cheap at 70B+ scale.


## Unlearning (`task='unlearn'`, NPO / SimNPO / RMU)

GDPR right-to-be-forgotten + CSAM/PII leak response, productized. Three method backends:

- **NPO** — Negative Preference Optimization (DPO-shaped negative-only loss; needs a reference model).
- **SimNPO** — length-normalised NPO without a ref model (faster, more stable on long sequences).
- **RMU** — Representation Misdirection Unlearning (residual-stream noise on forget inputs).

```yaml
# unlearn.yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: unlearn
data:
  train: traces.jsonl
  forget_set: gdpr_deletion_set.jsonl   # rows to unlearn (messages / prompt+completion / text)
  retain_set: capability_anchors.jsonl  # optional — anchors general capability
training:
  unlearn_method: npo           # or simnpo / rmu
  unlearn_alpha: 0.5            # retain-set weighting [0.0, 10.0]
```

```bash
# Run the unlearn loop (validated on SmolLM2-135M — NPO/SimNPO drive forget loss down).
soup train --config unlearn.yaml --yes

# Score the run on TOFU / MUSE / WMDP (OK / MINOR / MAJOR verdict).
soup eval unlearning <run-id> --benchmark tofu --evidence evidence.json --output report.json
```

`task: unlearn` is live (v0.71.9): it loads a LoRA-wrapped policy, a frozen reference copy (NPO / RMU), and the forget / retain JSONL sets, then optimises the per-method loss — NPO's `(2/β)·mean(-logσ(-β·(π_logp − ref_logp)))` drives the policy's forget-set log-prob below the reference (= forgetting), while the retain set anchors capability. Run NPO/SimNPO **with** a `retain_set` — without one the policy has no utility anchor and Soup warns loudly.

Unlearning honors `training.optimizer`, `scheduler`, `warmup_ratio`, `weight_decay`,
`max_grad_norm`, `batch_size` and `gradient_accumulation_steps`. The default
`batch_size: auto` resolves to 1 for unlearning rather than to the memory estimate
the other trainers use, so a config makes the same number of updates on any card. This
memory-constrained loop processes one example at a time and accumulates gradients
for `batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps` examples per optimizer update;
a final partial group is averaged by its actual size. `initial_loss` and
`final_loss` remain unscaled per-example losses, and `total_steps` and the 2,000-step
budget continue to count examples rather than optimizer updates.

`data.max_length` now controls forget and retain tokenization instead of the old
256-token cap. Its default is 2,048, so existing configurations can use more memory
and take longer. Set `data.max_length: 256` to retain the old sequence-length limit,
or explicitly choose a value that fits the model and device.

Three orthogonal axes: **Forget Quality** (pre/post forget-loss delta), **Model Utility** (retain-accuracy preserved), **PrivLeak** (membership-inference AUC distance from 0.5). Bundled mini-fixtures for all three benchmarks ship in the box (v0.71.1 added MUSE + WMDP alongside the existing TOFU set), so `--benchmark muse|wmdp` runs without supplying evidence. The WMDP forget-set probes ship **redacted** (placeholder prompts + `REFUSED` responses) — Soup never bundles verbatim hazardous-knowledge content.


## Continued Pre-training

Continue training a model on raw text for domain adaptation:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
task: pretrain

data:
  train: ./data/corpus.jsonl   # {"text": "..."} or plain .txt files
  format: plaintext
  max_length: 4096

training:
  epochs: 1
  lr: 1e-5
  quantization: 4bit
```

```bash
soup init --template pretrain
soup train
```


## Knowledge Distillation

Train a small student model to match a larger teacher's output distribution. Every train/val row must keep at least one causal-loss target after truncation at `data.max_length`, and a row without one is refused at setup by split and row number, as SFT does.

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: distill
modality: text
backend: transformers

data:
  train: ./data/chat.jsonl
  max_length: 2048
  chat_template: chatml

training:
  teacher_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
  distill_divergence: forward_kl   # kl | forward_kl | reverse_kl | js
  distill_temperature: 2.0
  distill_chunk_size: 256          # token chunk size for divergence evaluation
  distill_checkpoint: true         # non-reentrant activation checkpointing
  epochs: 3
  lr: 5e-5
```

Loss = student CE + (T**2) × KL(teacher_logits / T  ||  student_logits / T).
Teacher is loaded once, frozen via `requires_grad_(False)` + `.eval()`, and its
inputs / logits are auto-bridged across CPU / CUDA devices.

Distillation runs on `backend: transformers` only; `backend: mlx` and
`backend: unsloth` are refused at config load.
Gradient accumulation uses the number of shifted, non-masked training targets across the complete
optimizer window. Splitting the same rows into unequal-length microbatches therefore preserves the
full-batch token mean instead of weighting every microbatch equally.

The token-divergence kernel evaluates all three divergences in FP32 and deliberately
returns an FP32 scalar, including for FP16/BF16 logits. Forward-KL values can therefore
also differ slightly from the previous low-precision calculation. The log-space
reverse-KL and Jensen-Shannon formulas prevent finite losses with non-finite
gradients; the upcast also preserves small losses that would underflow to zero.
Non-finite logits propagate into the loss/gradients, allowing AMP's GradScaler to
skip overflowed steps rather than aborting training with a validation exception.

FP32 intermediates cost time and memory. The [maintainer's PR #736 measurement](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/736)
on an RTX 5070 (BF16, B=1/S=512/V=32000, forward plus backward) found the originally
submitted kernel took 1.71 times as long and 1.24 times the peak memory of main.
That measurement included finite-value guards removed here: without them it took
9.40 ms versus 6.39 ms, with the same 376.5 MiB versus 303.6 MiB peak. These are
hardware-specific measurements, not a benchmark of this revised implementation,
which also avoids unused probability tensors. Two FP32 logits copies alone occupy
about 7.8 GiB at B=4/S=2048/V=128256; budget for additional intermediates as well.

### Chunking and Activation Checkpointing

Distillation with large vocabularies (e.g. 150k for Qwen 2.5) and long sequences
can exhaust GPU memory due to massive intermediate logit and probability tensors.
Soup provides two controls to bound activation memory:

- `distill_chunk_size`: Evaluates divergence in chunks of active response tokens
  (`labels != -100`). Pre-filtering immediately sheds unmasked prompt and padding
  tokens from retained autograd memory, while chunking bounds transient peak
  activation tensors during divergence evaluation. Moderate chunk sizes (e.g. 64
  to 256 tokens) balance peak memory reduction with kernel launch overhead.
- `distill_checkpoint`: Wraps chunk evaluation in non-reentrant activation
  checkpointing (`torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(..., use_reentrant=False)`).
  Discards intermediate `log_softmax` and probability tensors during the forward
  pass and recomputes them during backward, substantially reducing retained autograd
  tensor bytes at the cost of recomputation time in the backward pass. Note that
  enabling `distill_checkpoint: true` without setting `distill_chunk_size` processes
  all active tokens in a single chunk, which reduces retained bytes via checkpointing
  but leaves transient peak activations unbounded.


Set `distill_mode: sequence` (default `token`) to train on the teacher's **generated
continuations** instead of per-token logit matching - a hard-label, cross-tokenizer-friendly
KD that works when student and teacher do not share a vocabulary. `sequence` mode is mutually
exclusive with the cross-tokenizer `uld_strategy` logit path (they are different objectives over
the same task; the trainer rejects the combination at setup). Rows with no prompt turn are
skipped, the count and first positions are printed at setup, a split left with no usable row is
refused before training, and a refusal names the row's position in your data. (v0.71.12)


## Sequence Classification

Train a classifier head on top of any base model — supports single-label,
multi-label, and cross-encoder reranking.

```yaml
base: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
task: classifier              # or `reranker`, `cross_encoder`
modality: text
backend: transformers

data:
  train: ./data/labelled.jsonl   # rows: {"text": "...", "label": "spam"} or {"text": "...", "label": [0, 2]}
  max_length: 256

training:
  num_labels: 3
  classifier_kind: single_label   # or `multi_label`
  label_names: [ham, spam, promo] # required when labels are strings
  epochs: 5
  lr: 2e-5
  batch_size: 32
```

**Row shapes by task:**
- `task: classifier`: Single-input sequences via `{"text": "sample", "label": 1}` or `{"text": "sample", "label": "spam"}` (also accepts ChatML rows carrying `label`). Multi-label datasets pass lists of active label indices or names: `{"text": "sample", "label": [0, 2]}` or `{"text": "sample", "label": ["ham", "promo"]}`.
- `task: reranker`: Query and document text via `{"text": "query doc", "label": "relevant"}` (or an integer class index).
- `task: cross_encoder`: Paired inputs via `{"text_a": "query", "text_b": "doc", "label": 1}` or `{"question": "query", "answer": "doc", "label": 1}`.

Routes `classifier` / `reranker` / `cross_encoder` through
`AutoModelForSequenceClassification`. Multi-label heads cap at 1024 entries per
row, dedup via set conversion, and reject null bytes in label strings.

Add a `lora:` section to train a **frozen encoder + LoRA adapter** classifier instead of the
full model — the small adapter plus the (freshly-initialised) classification head train, the
encoder backbone stays frozen:

```yaml
training:
  num_labels: 3
  lora:
    r: 16
    alpha: 32
```

(v0.71.12)


## Reasoning Effort + EOT Control

gpt-oss-style reasoning-effort control for instruction tuning.

```yaml
training:
  reasoning_effort: high      # low | medium | high
  train_on_eot: true          # do NOT mask the EOT/EOS token in the loss
```

`reasoning_effort` injects `<|reasoning_effort|>high<|/reasoning_effort|>` into
the system turn (creating one if absent). `train_on_eot=True` makes the model
learn when to stop generating by training on the trailing EOS token instead of
masking it out. Both are gated to the SFT-family of tasks.


## EBFT / GDPO Loss Variants

**`training.gdpo_variant` is refused at config load**
([#1309](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/1309)). This breaks configs
that set `standard`, `length_normalized`, or `margin`: previously they loaded but
silently trained the default loss, because supported TRL versions (0.29 and later)
do not expose the `DPOTrainer.dpo_loss` hook. Every non-null value is refused;
unset and null still load. No shipped recipe, template or example sets the field.

Remove `gdpo_variant` to train plain `task: dpo` for `standard`. For
`length_normalized`, `task: simpo` is the nearest objective, **not an identical
replacement**. `margin` has no equivalent. Plain DPO, without a GDPO setting:

```yaml
task: dpo
training:
  dpo_beta: 0.1
```

EBFT (`ebft_variant: structured | strided`) is refused at config load
([#1230](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/1230)): it is not yet a
distinct objective. The term it added scored each position's logits against that
position's own input token, with no causal shift, so it rewarded copying the input
over predicting the next token; shifted onto the next token it is the model's own
cross-entropy, so the loss would count cross-entropy twice. A config that set it
never trained correctly. Remove `ebft_variant` and `ebft_temperature`; the refusal
stays until the intended EBFT objective is implemented from its reference.


## GRPO Objective Variants

Soup ships live math kernels for 6 GRPO objective variants in addition to the
default. Set `grpo_variant` in `training` and the trainer automatically
subclasses `trl.GRPOTrainer` to route `compute_loss` through the matching
kernel:

```yaml
task: grpo
training:
  reward_fn: accuracy
  num_generations: 4
  grpo_variant: gspo         # sequence-level length-normalized ratio
  # or: dapo / dr_grpo / bnpo / rft / two_sided
  # grpo_delta: 0.2          # required when grpo_variant=two_sided; optional for gspo
```

Variants:

- **standard** — DeepSeek-R1-style baseline (delegates to TRL's `compute_loss`).
- **gspo** — Group Sequence Policy Optimization (sequence-level length-normalized ratio with clipping).
- **dapo** — decoupled asymmetric clipping (`eps_lo=0.2, eps_hi=0.28`).
- **dr_grpo** — token-sum without per-sample length normalisation.
- **bnpo** — length-normalised PPO surrogate.
- **two_sided** — symmetric clipping with operator-supplied `grpo_delta`.
- **rft** — rejection-sampling fine-tuning (only positive-advantage tokens contribute).

Every variant applies `grpo_beta` (default `0.1`) as a KL penalty against the
reference policy, where trl's own GRPO loss puts it: trl's per-token estimator
`exp(ref - logp) - (ref - logp) - 1`, weighted by `grpo_beta` and reduced the
same way as that variant's policy term. `rft` applies it only to the accepted
completions it trains on. The β that the reward-hack controller sets at runtime
(`kl_control` / `pid_lagrangian`) reaches every variant the same way.
Set `grpo_beta: 0` for a KL-free run (no KL penalty against the reference policy,
skipping the reference forward pass entirely), as used by the published DAPO and
Dr. GRPO recipes ([#1247](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/1247)).

With a non-zero `grpo_beta`, a variant run logs the same `kl` metric as trl's stock
loss: the batch mean of that per-token estimate over the completion tokens (over the
accepted tokens only, for `rft`), as `kl` in training and `eval_kl` in evaluation.

The stability callback (EMA ref-model update, replay buffer, TIS alert counter)
attaches automatically when any of `ref_model_ema_alpha` / `replay_buffer_size`
/ `tis_threshold` / etc. is set.


## Process Reward Model (PRM)

Train a scalar reward head over stepwise-supervised reasoning chains. Data
format is the v0.42.0 `prm` shape — one row per `{prompt, completions: [step1,
step2, ...], labels: [r1, r2, ...]}`:

```yaml
task: prm
data:
  format: prm
  train: ./prm_train.jsonl
  max_length: 2048
training:
  epochs: 1
  lr: 1.0e-5
```

The trainer loads `AutoModelForCausalLM`, attaches an `nn.Linear(hidden, 1)`
reward head, and computes MSE between predicted scalars at step-boundary tokens
and the per-step labels. The reward head is saved inside the model checkpoint
(`reward_head.*` in `model.safetensors`) and the tokenizer is saved alongside it,
so the resulting directory is loadable standalone.

PRM trains every base parameter along with the head, so all of them load as fp32
master weights on every device. On CUDA, autocast runs the forward pass in bf16 (fp16 on
pre-Ampere cards); on MPS it uses bf16 where the runtime supports it; CPU trains in fp32.
With the default optimizer (AdamW), budget about 16 bytes per parameter before
activations (fp32 weights, fp32 gradients and two fp32 AdamW moments), which is what the
VRAM pre-flight predicts for `task: prm` when `batch_size` is an integer (with the
default `batch_size: auto` the pre-flight does not run). The saved checkpoint is fp32, and
without DeepSpeed loading the fp32 base needs about twice the host RAM of a bf16 load. Under DeepSpeed,
each rank loads the base in fp32 on the host before the engine exists (4 bytes per
parameter of host RAM per rank); the engine then casts it to its bf16/fp16 dtype, keeps
its own fp32 master copy and saves a 16-bit checkpoint. A bf16 base without master
weights would round most updates away at these learning rates (#1235).


## PRM-guided GRPO (process-supervised RL)

Use a trained PRM as the **per-step reward** inside GRPO — the o1-era
process-supervision signal. Set `training.prm_reward` to a PRM directory (a
`task=prm` checkpoint) or HF id; the PRM splits each generated completion into
reasoning steps (newline heuristic), scores every step with its reward head, and
folds the per-step scores into one scalar reward that GRPO optimises. It
**replaces** `reward_fn` and rides the existing reward-shaping +
reward-hack-mitigation seam, so the v0.71.26 controller still observes it (TRL
logs it as `rewards/prm_reward`).

```yaml
task: grpo
backend: transformers        # required (the PRM reward runs a transformers forward)
modality: text               # required
data:
  format: chatml
  train: ./grpo_prompts.jsonl
training:
  prm_reward: ./my-prm       # a `soup train task=prm` checkpoint dir (or HF id)
  prm_aggregate: min         # weakest-link (default) | prod | last
  num_generations: 4
  grpo_beta: 0.04
```

`prm_aggregate='min'` (weakest-link, the standard PRM aggregation) is the safe
default; `prod` assumes calibrated `[0,1]` step scores (Soup's PRM head is
trained with unconstrained MSE, so `prod` can blow up on uncalibrated labels).

**Bundled rollout environments.** Three deterministic pure-Python toy
environments seed the openenv rollout path out-of-the-box — pair any of them
with `rollout_backend=openenv`:

```yaml
training:
  rollout_backend: openenv
  rollout_func: soup_cli.envs.calculator:rollout   # or retrieval_qa / guess_number
  reward_fn: verifiable
  verifiable_domain: math
```

Ready-made recipes: `grpo-env-calculator`, `grpo-env-retrieval-qa`,
`grpo-env-guess-number`. The environments are deterministic single-shot
prompt/answer *seeders* (the live openenv contract passes only the seed prompts,
not the model) — not interactive multi-turn episodes.

**Scope:** proof-of-mechanism only — validated on SmolLM2-135M with a tiny
synthetic PRM (the PRM reward scores good completions above bad and drives GRPO's
advantages). Not a production reward-model claim; scale validation is help-wanted
(#286).


## Online DPO (`task='online_dpo'`) — judge in the loop (v0.71.31)

Unlike offline DPO (static `prompt/chosen/rejected` rows), **Online DPO** generates
two completions per prompt **on-policy** each step and asks a *judge* — or a
*reward model* — which is better; the winner becomes `chosen`, the loser
`rejected`. The judge closes the loop. Wraps TRL `OnlineDPOTrainer`; data is
prompt-only (like GRPO). Transformers + text only.

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct
task: online_dpo
data:
  train: ./data/prompts.jsonl      # prompt-only (or any format — prompts are extracted)
training:
  online_dpo_judge: "ollama://llama3.1"   # a pairwise judge (ollama://|https://|http://localhost)
  # OR: reward_model: ./my-reward-model   # exactly one of judge / reward_model
  online_dpo_loss_type: sigmoid           # sigmoid | ipo
  online_dpo_max_new_tokens: 64
  dpo_beta: 0.1
  lora: { r: 8, alpha: 16, target_modules: auto }
```

The judge is Soup's own OpenAI-compatible `JudgeEvaluator` adapted to TRL's
`BasePairwiseJudge` (swap-debiased: a winner is only recorded when both A,B and
B,A orders agree). Recipe: `online-dpo-smollm2-135m`. Proof-of-mechanism was
validated on SmolLM2-135M with a synthetic judge (not a production RLHF claim; #286).
An `https://` judge URL uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` only when its host is `api.openai.com`; other
hosts are called as an OpenAI-compatible server without that key. An `online_dpo_judge` whose
host is a private, link-local or reserved IP literal is refused when soup.yaml loads (loopback
stays allowed); address an internal judge by its hostname. A host written only as numbers that
is not a valid IPv4 address (`10.0.0.256`, `4294967296`) is refused as well.

A pair the judge cannot rank is left out of the loss: a tie, a failed or unreadable judge
call, or a verdict that changes when the two completions are swapped. Such a pair adds no
gradient, and the loss is the mean over the ranked pairs of each batch. The share of unranked
pairs is logged as `judge/invalid_rate`, with a WARNING the first time it happens and on every
step in which nothing was ranked. The logged `loss` and `train_loss` average only the batches
that ranked a pair, and a logging window in which nothing was ranked logs no `loss` at all.
A step in which nothing was ranked is not skipped: the optimizer still steps, so AdamW
momentum and weight decay keep moving the weights and the learning-rate schedule advances.
That drift is bounded: if the judge ranks none of 32 pairs in a row (for example because its
server is down), training stops with an error that names the judge, and a shorter run in
which it ranked no pair at all fails the same way instead of saving an adapter. Before this,
TRL trained every such pair as if the second completion had won (#1225).


## Weighted Multi-Objective Preference Loss

Mix DPO / SimPO / ORPO / IPO terms in one training run by setting
`preference_loss_weights` (must sum to 1.0):

```yaml
task: preference
training:
  preference_loss_weights:
    simpo: 0.6
    orpo: 0.4
```

The combine wrapper computes a weighted sum via the in-tree
`compute_dpo_term` / `compute_simpo_term` / `compute_orpo_term` /
`compute_ipo_term` kernels. On trl 0.29 it reads the per-sequence log-probs
those kernels need out of the primary trainer's own forward pass
(`concatenated_forward`), so which blends train depends on which trainer is
built:

| Blend | Result on trl 0.29 |
| --- | --- |
| `simpo` + `orpo` | Trains. The CPO (SimPO) and ORPO trainers both return their per-sequence log-probs. |
| anything naming `dpo` or `ipo` | Stops at the first step and names the terms. They need a frozen reference model this path does not build, so there are no reference log-probs to read — and their own trainers compute log-probs inline, publishing only means. |
| `bco` mixed with anything | Rejected at config load (data format incompatible). |

**What a term is.** In a blend, `simpo` and `orpo` are their *preference terms
only* — the margin / odds-ratio objective — without the likelihood (NLL) term
the standalone `preference_loss: simpo` / `preference_loss: orpo` runs carry. A
`{simpo: 1.0}` blend is therefore not the same number as a `preference_loss:
simpo` run, and `training.cpo_alpha` does not affect it. Use
`training.preference_loss` when you want the full standalone loss. Each term
does honour its own config field: `training.simpo_gamma` for SimPO,
`training.orpo_beta` for ORPO, whichever loss has the larger weight or not.

**Evaluation.** With `val_split` set, trl's `prediction_step` calls
`get_batch_loss_metrics` directly, so the eval loss is the primary loss's own
trl loss — not the blend's value. Training and evaluation therefore report
different numbers for the same batch.


## MoE Model Support

Fine-tune Mixture of Experts models (Mixtral, Qwen3-30B-A3B, DeepSeek V3) with ScatterMoE LoRA — applies LoRA to both attention layers and expert FFN layers:

```yaml
base: Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B
task: sft

training:
  moe_lora: true              # target expert + attention layers
  moe_aux_loss_coeff: 0.01    # router load-balancing loss
  quantization: 4bit
```

Soup auto-detects MoE architectures. Not every task reads `moe_lora`: the per-task table in [Performance and quantization](performance-and-quantization.md#moe-expert-quantization--router-only-training-live-in-v07120) lists the tasks that apply it and the ones that refuse it at config load.

```bash
soup init --template moe
soup train
```


## Vision / Multimodal Fine-tuning

Fine-tune vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-Vision, Qwen2-VL, Pixtral) on image+text data:

```bash
# Install vision support
pip install "soup-cli[vision]"

# Create a vision config
soup init --template vision

# Train
soup train --config soup.yaml
```

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct
task: sft
modality: vision

data:
  train: ./data/vision_train.jsonl
  format: llava
  image_dir: ./data/images
  val_split: 0.1

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
  quantization: 4bit
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
```

**Supported vision data formats:**

**LLaVA:**
```json
{"image": "photo.jpg", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "<image>\nDescribe this image."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "A cat on a mat."}]}
```

**ShareGPT4V:**
```json
{"image": "chart.png", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "<image>\nWhat does this show?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Quarterly revenue."}]}
```

A relative `image` path resolves against `data.image_dir`, or against the data file's
directory when it is unset. A Hub dataset or a remote URI has no data file directory, so set
`data.image_dir` when its rows hold image paths; see
[Data Pipeline Pro](data.md#data-pipeline-pro).

`soup data inspect` automatically shows image statistics (count, formats, missing files) for vision datasets.


## Audio / Speech Fine-tuning

Fine-tune audio-language models (Qwen2-Audio, Whisper) on audio+text data:

```bash
# Install audio support
pip install "soup-cli[audio]"

# Create an audio config
soup init --template audio

# Train
soup train --config soup.yaml
```

```yaml
base: Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct
task: sft
modality: audio

data:
  train: ./data/audio_train.jsonl
  format: audio
  audio_dir: ./data/audio
  val_split: 0.1

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
  quantization: 4bit
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
```

**Audio data format:**
```json
{"audio": "recording.wav", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Transcribe this audio."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello world."}]}
```

### ASR fine-tuning (`task='asr'`, Whisper) — v0.71.32

Fine-tune Whisper on your accent or domain. whisper-tiny (39M) and base (74M)
train on a 4 GB GPU. Rows are `{"audio": <path>, "text": <transcript>}` under
`data.format='asr'`; audio decodes to 16 kHz mono through the hardened loader.

```yaml
base: openai/whisper-tiny
task: asr
data:
  train: ./data/train.jsonl
  format: asr                 # rows: {"audio": "clip.wav", "text": "hello world"}
  audio_dir: ./data/audio     # audio paths resolve here (containment-checked)
training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-4
  batch_size: 2
  asr_language: en            # optional; sets + persists the decoder prefix
  asr_task: transcribe        # transcribe | translate
  asr_lora: true              # optional LoRA on q/v; default = full fine-tune
  quantization: none
output: ./out
```

```json
{"audio": "clip0.wav", "text": "hello world"}
```

Transcribe + score after training:

```bash
soup infer --task asr --model ./out --input eval.jsonl --output preds.jsonl --audio-dir ./data/audio
# -> preds carry {"transcription", "wer", "cer"} per row + a corpus WER summary
```

Notes: `task='asr'` requires `backend='transformers'` and a Whisper base (a
non-Whisper base is rejected before download). `asr_language`/`asr_task` persist
to an `asr_generation.json` sidecar so `soup infer --task asr` restores them
(override with `--asr-language`/`--asr-task`). WER/CER use a light normalizer —
good for before/after deltas, not leaderboard-comparable absolutes.
`whisper-large-v3-asr` ships parse-only (needs a larger GPU).


## GRPO Plus — Objective Variants, Long-Context RL, Multi-Turn Agents

Soup ships seven GRPO objective variants, between-rollouts vLLM standby, four agent-rollout backends, seven stability/efficiency knobs, plus Process Reward Models.

```yaml
# soup.yaml — DAPO with replay buffer and TIS truncation masking
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: grpo
data:
  train: ./prompts.jsonl
  format: chatml
training:
  reward_fn: accuracy
  num_generations: 8
  # New: GRPO objective variants
  grpo_variant: dapo                  # one of: gspo / dapo / dr_grpo / bnpo / two_sided / rft / standard
  # grpo_delta: 0.2                   # required when grpo_variant: two_sided (optional for gspo)
  grpo_fp16: true                     # FP16 RL (unsloth parity)
  # Long-context + memory-efficient RL
  # long_context_grpo: true           # staged for future Tiled MLP; refused as of v0.77 — #808
  vllm_sleep_mode: true               # between-rollouts vLLM standby — LIVE (vLLM >= 0.7)
  # Multi-turn agent rollout — openenv is LIVE: your function's rows replace the prompt dataset
  rollout_backend: openenv            # one of: art / ruler / nemo_gym / openenv
  rollout_func: my_module:my_rollout  # module:function resolver (openenv; trusted operator code)
  # Stability / efficiency knobs
  ref_model_ema_alpha: 0.99           # EMA sync policy → reference
  replay_buffer_size: 2048
  async_grpo_prefetch: true           # overlap rollout + train
  tis_threshold: 2.0                  # truncated importance sampling
  mask_truncated_completions: true    # paired with tis_threshold
  defer_rerolling: true
  skip_zero_advantage: true
  off_policy_mask_threshold: 0.5
```

Process Reward Models (stepwise-supervised):

```yaml
# soup.yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
task: prm                              # New: Process Reward Model
data:
  train: ./prm_dataset.jsonl
  format: prm                          # stepwise-supervised data shape
training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
```

Vision RL on Qwen2-VL / Pixtral / InternVL (Staged):

```yaml
# soup.yaml
base: Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
task: grpo
modality: vision
data:
  train: ./vlm_prompts.jsonl
  format: llava
training:
  reward_fn: accuracy
  # vision_grpo: true                  # staged for VLM-RL; refused as of v0.77 — #808
```

All flags shipped as schema gates in v0.50.0. `vllm_sleep_mode`, `openenv` rollout, and PRM training (`task: prm`) are live. Other rollout backends (`art`, `ruler`, `nemo_gym`) raise "not yet validated", while unconsumed staged flags (e.g. `long_context_grpo`, `vision_grpo`) warn in v0.76 and are refused as of v0.77 (#808).


## DPO Training

Train with preference data using Direct Preference Optimization:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: dpo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  dpo_beta: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```


## Preference Variety — BCO + Unified Dispatcher + KL Variants

Five preference losses live behind one config knob. Pick a loss without
renaming your task, anneal β over training, and periodically refresh the
frozen reference.

### BCO (Binary Classifier Optimization)

Same input format as DPO; rows are split internally to TRL's BCO
unpaired schema (`{prompt, completion, label}`).

```yaml
task: bco
data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo
training:
  bco_beta: 0.1
```

### Unified preference dispatcher

Use `task: preference` + `training.preference_loss` to swap losses
without touching `task`. Hyperparameter sweeps over the loss type
itself become trivial.

```yaml
task: preference
data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo
training:
  preference_loss: dpo   # or simpo, orpo, ipo, bco
```

Legacy `task: dpo` / `task: simpo` / etc. remain first-class — the
unified surface is additive.

### KL-controlled DPO variants

Anneal β over training with `dpo_beta_schedule`:

```yaml
task: dpo   # or task: preference + preference_loss: dpo, or task: ipo
training:
  dpo_beta: 0.1
  dpo_beta_schedule: linear   # linear | cosine | exponential
  dpo_beta_end: 0.01
```

Gated to DPO-family tasks (`dpo`, `ipo`, or `preference` with `preference_loss in {dpo, ipo}`); transformers backend only. `dpo_ref_regen_epochs` is refused at config load: it never regenerated the reference. With LoRA there is no separate reference model to copy into, and the DPO-family trainers cannot run with `lora.r: 0`. The wiring is tracked in [#1345](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/1345).

### Multi-objective preference loss

```yaml
task: preference
training:
  preference_loss_weights: {simpo: 0.7, orpo: 0.3}
```

Schema validates 2–5 entries summing to 1, and rejects `bco` mixed with a
paired loss at config load. On trl 0.29 a `simpo` + `orpo` blend trains; any
blend naming `dpo` or `ipo` stops at the first step naming the terms it could
not compute, because those trainers publish no per-sequence log-probs to read
(see [Weighted Multi-Objective Preference Loss](#weighted-multi-objective-preference-loss)).
Set `training.preference_loss` for a single loss.


## GRPO Training (Reasoning)

Train reasoning models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeepSeek-R1 style):

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: grpo

data:
  train: ./data/reasoning_train.jsonl
  format: sharegpt
  max_length: 4096

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
  grpo_beta: 0.1  # KL penalty; 0 = KL-free (DAPO / Dr. GRPO)
  num_generations: 4
  reward_fn: accuracy   # or 'format', or path to custom .py
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```

```bash
# Create a reasoning config
soup init --template reasoning

# Train
soup train --config soup.yaml
```

**Gradient watchdog (#342).** If non-finite gradients (NaN or Inf) appear during
a GRPO run, the optimizer step is skipped: weights and optimizer state are
unchanged, and the step still counts toward the step total and the LR schedule.
The skipped-step count is logged at the end of the run (as a console warning
when the fraction exceeds 5%) and persisted in `trainer_state.json` so
`soup adapters audit` can see it.

**Built-in reward functions:**
- `accuracy` — 1.0 when the completion's final answer matches the gold's, else 0.0 (no partial credit)
- `format` — checks for structured `<think>...</think>` reasoning blocks

`accuracy` and verifiable `math` read the completion and the gold with the same parser. The final
answer is, in this order of precedence:

1. the rest of the line after the last `####` (a `#### Final Answer` heading means the next line);
2. the content of the last `\boxed{}` (a space before the brace and nested braces such as
   `\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}` are fine);
3. what follows the last `The answer is` or `Answer:` (also `**Answer**:`, and the answer may be
   on the next line), up to the end of its clause: a `. `, `, ` or `; ` outside brackets, or at
   the connective `because` or `since` (case-insensitive, requiring whitespace on both sides; not `as`).
   A comma or semicolon that a number follows continues a list instead (`41, 42 or 43`), and a
   parenthetical aside belongs to the clause. So `The answer is Washington, D.C.`
   reads `Washington`, `The answer is 42 (six times seven).` reads `42`, and `The answer is (3, 4).`
   reads `(3, 4)`.

A box outranks a phrase, and a `\boxed{}` or phrase that comes after a `####` line outranks it (the
line was a markdown heading, or an answer the text went on to correct). That includes chatter:
`#### Paris` followed by `I hope this answer is helpful!` reads `helpful`, so end a completion at
its `####` line. A completion with none of these is read by its last line and its last number, so
`Six times seven is 42.` and even `Not 42.` read as 42; only the final number counts, so listing
candidates earns nothing.

An answer phrase's number is read from its own clause: `The answer is 41 apples, not 42.` reads
41, because the clause ends at the comma. A clause that names **more than one distinct value** is
a hedge and states no answer: `The answer is either 41 or 42.`, `Answer: 41 or 42`,
`The answer is 42 (or 43).` and `the answer is 41, 42 or 43` score 0.0 against every gold, and a
gold written that way is refused. A `because` / `since` inline or after punctuation ends the clause
(`The answer is 42 because 6*7=42.` and `The answer is 42, because 6*7=42.` both read 42),
while parenthetical justifications belong to the clause and hedge it (`The answer is 42 (6*7=42).`).
The same value twice is not a hedge (`42 (i.e. 42.0)`), and the digits of one bracketed or LaTeX
answer (`(3, 4)`, `\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}`, `\frac{14}{3}`, `2^{10}`) or of a time
or a ratio (`3:45`, `1:1,000`) are not separate values; such an answer is compared as text.
`\boxed{}` and `####` answers are compared whole, so a list there is one answer, and it can only
match a gold that is the same list.

A numeric gold is compared by value, so `#### 1,000`, `\boxed{1000}` and `The answer is $1000.`
all match a gold of `1000`. Any other gold (`\frac{14}{3}`, `p - q`, `Paris`) is compared as text,
ignoring case and whitespace, `$`, `\(...\)` and `\[...\]`, `\left` / `\right`, and `\dfrac` /
`\tfrac` versus `\frac`; so `\boxed{\dfrac{14}{3}}` matches a gold of `\frac{14}{3}`. Both sides
also drop the trailing punctuation `. , ; : !`, LaTeX thousands separators such as `1{,}000`, the
LaTeX spacing commands `\,` `\!` `\;` `\:` and `\ `, and a Unicode minus sign. A `\\` row break is
kept whole, so a matrix matches however its rows are spaced. One `\text{}` / `\textbf{}` /
`\mathrm{}` / `\mbox{}` wrapper is unwrapped to its contents, `^\circ` / `^{\circ}` / `°` are
dropped, a compact `\frac` argument is braced to match whether it is a single bare character or
an already-braced group, with or without a space before it (`\frac12`, `\frac1{2}`, `\frac{1}2`,
`\frac 34` and `\frac9{19}` all read `\frac{N}{D}`), and a one-letter variable prefix reads its
right-hand side (`x = 7` reads `7`, on either side), though when both sides name a variable and
the names differ (`x = 3` against `y = 3`), the pair scores 0.0, since a directrix or an
asymptote's variable is part of its answer. Units are still not stripped (`42 apples` against
`42`), and nothing is evaluated (`\frac{1}{2}` does not equal `0.5`).

For GRPO, Soup preserves source dataset columns and TRL passes them to reward functions as
keyword arguments. An Alpaca `output` or the final assistant turn in ShareGPT/ChatML is also
exposed as `answer`; an explicit `answer` column takes precedence. Gold-dependent built-ins
validate their inputs before generation:

| Reward | Required source metadata |
|---|---|
| `accuracy` or verifiable `math` | `answer`, or an assistant reference response, that states a final answer |
| verifiable `code` | `expected` or `answer` |
| verifiable `json_schema` | `schema` |

A gold states its final answer with `####`, `\boxed{}`, `The answer is` or `Answer:`, or by being
the bare answer on one line (`42`, `Paris`, `\frac{14}{3}`). A row whose gold states none (for
example a multi-line reference solution with no marked answer, or one under a `#### Solution`
heading: a `####` line that is not a number and has more text after it may be a markdown heading,
so a gold cannot rely on it), or whose answer phrase hedges between values
(`The answer is either 41 or 42.`), is refused before generation, with its split,
row number and field and a count of the other rows with the same problem, because such a gold
would score every completion 0.0 and give GRPO no signal. A dataset that mixes numeric and
LaTeX golds, such as MATH-500, loads under `math` too; validation prints how many golds are
non-numeric and therefore compared as normalised text.

**Custom reward functions** — point to a Python file:
```python
# my_reward.py
def reward_fn(completions, **kwargs):
    """Score each completion. Return list of floats."""
    return [1.0 if "correct" in c[-1]["content"] else 0.0 for c in completions]
```
```yaml
training:
  reward_fn: ./my_reward.py
```

Custom rewards can read any preserved source column through `kwargs`. They must return exactly
one finite numeric score per completion; Soup checks this contract and reports the reward name
and count before TRL attempts to build a reward tensor.

**Reward ensembles** — list several rewards, comma-separated, and they combine (GRPO only).
This also unlocks the `rm_ensemble` reward-hack detector, which needs ≥ 2 rewards:
```yaml
training:
  reward_fn: "accuracy,format"   # both are scored every step
```

### Synthesize a verifier from your data (`soup reward synth`)

Don't hand-write a verifier — generate one from reference (gold) outputs. Soup infers a
*deterministic* verifier (numeric / JSON-schema / regex / tool-call), writes a readable, editable
`.py`, and **refuses to emit** one that can't tell your references from auto-generated bad answers
(the mandatory calibration report). The emitted file is a normal `reward_fn: reward.py`.

```bash
# infer + calibrate + emit (exit 0 kept, 2 refused, 1 error)
soup reward synth references.jsonl -o reward.py --output-report calib.json

# preview the induced spec without writing anything
soup reward synth references.jsonl --plan-only

# force a family instead of auto-detecting
soup reward synth answers.jsonl -o reward.py --kind numeric --tolerance 1e-6
```

References are a JSONL where each row's gold answer is in an `answer` field (override with
`--field`) or the last assistant turn of a `messages` list. `--min-discrimination` sets how
strongly the verifier must separate references from perturbed negatives before it's emitted.
v1 is deterministic families only — a `\boxed{}`/`####` marker helps the numeric verifier, and
completions are prompted to mark their answer (standard RLVR practice). The numeric verifier
reads both the gold and the completion with the parser the built-in `math` / `accuracy` rewards
use (`soup_cli.utils.final_answer`), so `#### 1,000`, `\boxed {42}` and a `6*7=42\n#### 42` gold
score the same under both; references written `1,000` count as numeric. The calibration report
names every reference the emitted verifier rejects (`rejected_references` in `--output-report`).

**Changed:** a `reward.py` synthesized before this version pulled the last number with a local
regex; ones synthesized now read both sides with the shared answer parser, so `1,000`-style
golds and `The answer is …` completions score where they scored 0 before — regenerate old
verifiers before comparing runs. Regeneration also stops paying some completions the old regex
paid: a `####` or `\boxed{}` answer carrying units, `%` or a non-dollar currency symbol or
code (`#### 42 apples`, `\boxed{42\%}`, `#### €42`, `#### 42 USD`), a hedged or justified answer phrase (`The answer is either 41 or
42`, `The answer is 42 because 6*7=42`), and a completion whose last `\boxed{}` is wrong after
a right first one now score 0 — matching the built-ins. A bare `42%` or `The answer is 42%.`
still pays, as under the built-ins; only marker-delimited answers refuse suffixes. The emitted
file imports `soup_cli`, so it runs where Soup is installed rather than being fully
self-contained.

### Stress-test a verifier for gameability (`soup reward stress`)

A verifier that passes calibration still might pay out for junk. `soup reward stress` feeds the
verifier deterministic degenerate completions — empty, length-padded, repeated, and
sentinel-spam — scored against your real gold answers, and flags any it **accepts**. It's the
adversarial counterpart to `synth`: calibration proves the verifier tells references from
*friendly* bad answers; `stress` asks whether a reward-hacking model could game it.

```bash
# probe a synthesized verifier (or any reward .py) — exit 0 robust, 2 gameable, 1 error
soup reward stress reward.py --references golds.jsonl --output-report stress.json

# probe a builtin verifier instead of a .py file
soup reward stress verifiable --verifiable-domain math --references golds.jsonl

# JSON-schema references may be stored as objects in a `schema` field
soup reward stress verifiable --verifiable-domain json_schema \
    --references schemas.jsonl --field schema

# tune the attack set / accept threshold / gameability tolerance
soup reward stress reward.py --references golds.jsonl \
    --attacks empty,length,repetition,sentinel,wrapped_junk,answer_spray \
    --sentinel GOLD --threshold 0.5 --max-gameable 0.0
```

The report shows a per-attack accept-rate and an overall verdict. A gold-requiring verifier probed
with **no** `--references` is a hard error (it can't be measured), never a false "robust". Because
each attack family evaluates multiple distinct variants across sampled references (up to 23 batched
verifier invocations, or 4,600 scored completions at the 200-gold cap), slow or model-based verifiers
will take proportionally longer than simple string checks. Probing a `.py` executes its module code,
like any custom reward — only stress files you trust.
For the builtin `json_schema` domain, references are forwarded as `schema=` metadata; JSON objects
selected by `--field` are decoded before the verifier scores them.

Current limitation: the built-in attack families emit plain text that is not valid JSON, so
`json_schema` rejects them during parsing before schema-specific constraints are evaluated. The
result therefore does not yet distinguish a strict schema from a permissive one. Its `reference_accept`
value is also not a meaningful self-acceptance control for this domain because it scores the schema
document as though it were an instance of itself (and is normally `0%`).

### Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)

Use `reward_fn: verifiable` with a `verifiable_domain` for deterministic, math-checkable rewards — no judge model, no heuristics. Great for GRPO on math, code, or structured-output tasks.

```yaml
training:
  reward_fn: verifiable
  verifiable_domain: math          # or: code, json_schema
  num_generations: 4
```

Three built-in domains:

| Domain | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `math` | Reads the final answer of the completion and of the gold with the shared parser described under "Built-in reward functions" (`####`, `\boxed{}`, `The answer is` / `Answer:`, else the completion's last number). A numeric gold scores 1.0 within 1e-4 and 0.6 within 1e-2 (compared as exact decimals); any other gold scores 1.0 on a normalised text match. Nothing is evaluated: no `eval()` on user output |
| `code` | Executes generated Python with a 5s timeout, 512 MB RLIMIT on POSIX, `python -I -S`, socket patch, ephemeral cwd. Output capped at 10KB. Warning panel on first use |
| `json_schema` | Validates output against a JSON Schema provided per-example in the dataset |

> **Note:** `code` domain runs untrusted generations. Soup sandboxes aggressively but never trust it for production-grade isolation — run in a VM or container for public data.


## Tool-Calling Fine-Tuning

Train models to emit structured function calls (OpenAI-style `tool_calls` with JSON arguments).

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: sft

data:
  train: ./data/tool_calls.jsonl
  format: tool-calling

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 2e-5
  quantization: 4bit
```

**Tool-calling data format:**
```json
{"messages": [
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [
    {"id": "c1", "type": "function",
     "function": {"name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{\"city\": \"Paris\"}"}}
  ]}
]}
```

Add a top-level `tools` list (OpenAI function schemas) to put the schemas in front of the model as a system turn; with `format: auto`, a row with `messages` and `tools` is detected as tool-calling. Multi-turn trajectories keep their order: each assistant turn keeps its `tool_calls` and each `tool` turn its `tool_call_id`. The older shape, with the calls in a top-level `tool_calls` list, still loads: those calls become one assistant turn after `messages`.

Arguments are parsed as JSON only — never `eval()`. `soup eval custom` can score tool-call accuracy (function name + argument JSON equality).

```bash
soup init --template tool-calling
```


## PPO / Full RLHF Pipeline

Train models with the full RLHF pipeline: SFT warmup → Reward Model → PPO alignment.

```bash
# Create an RLHF config
soup init --template rlhf
```

**Step 1: SFT warmup** — fine-tune a base model on your data:
```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: sft
data:
  train: ./data/train.jsonl
  format: alpaca
output: ./output_sft
```

**Step 2: Train reward model** — learn preferences from human feedback:
```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: reward_model
data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo
output: ./output_rm
```

**Step 3: PPO alignment** — optimize the policy using the reward model:
```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: ppo
data:
  train: ./data/prompts.jsonl
  format: chatml
training:
  reward_model: ./output_rm
  epochs: 1
  ppo_epochs: 4
  ppo_clip_ratio: 0.2
  ppo_kl_penalty: 0.05
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
output: ./output_ppo
```

`epochs` controls complete passes over the training dataset. `ppo_epochs`
controls optimization passes within each PPO update. Soup forwards both values,
plus `ppo_kl_penalty`, to the active TRL `PPOConfig` names and prints the
effective schedule during setup.

One PPO rollout batch is `batch_size` x `gradient_accumulation_steps` prompts on
every process, and TRL drops a partial batch, so the train set needs at least
`batch_size` x `gradient_accumulation_steps` x the number of processes rows.
A smaller one would never reach a step, so `soup train` refuses it before loading
any model and names the row count and both settings.

**Saving and resuming experimental PPO.** With TRL 0.29.1 and Transformers
5.19.0, Soup restores the policy's save-state initialization that TRL's PPO
constructor omits. Both in-training checkpoint saves and the final adapter save
use the native trainer path; the final adapter can be reloaded with PEFT.
Experimental TRL's `checkpoint-N` directories contain the policy and optimizer,
scheduler, RNG and trainer state, but not a complete resumable policy-plus-critic
training state. Its `train()` does not accept `resume_from_checkpoint`: Soup
warns and starts from scratch. A saved inference adapter is not proof of PPO
training resumption.

PPO supports two reward sources:
- **Reward model** (`reward_model`): pre-trained reward model (from step 2)
- **Reward function** (`reward_fn`): callable function (same as GRPO — `accuracy`, `format`, or custom `.py`)


## KTO Training (Unpaired Preferences)

Train with unpaired preference data — no need for chosen+rejected pairs:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: kto

data:
  train: ./data/kto_train.jsonl
  format: kto

training:
  epochs: 3
  kto_beta: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```

**Batch size.** KTO needs a per-device `batch_size` of at least 2: TRL's KL term is degenerate at batch 1, so `batch_size: 1` is refused when the config is loaded. `batch_size: auto` never resolves below 2, and `soup local-rl train --train-method kto` writes `batch_size: 2`. Raise `gradient_accumulation_steps` for a larger effective batch.

**KTO data format:**
```json
{"prompt": "What is 2+2?", "completion": "4", "label": true}
{"prompt": "What is 2+2?", "completion": "Fish", "label": false}
```


## ORPO Training (No Reference Model)

ORPO combines SFT and alignment in one step — no reference model needed:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: orpo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  orpo_beta: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```


## SimPO Training (Simple Preference)

SimPO uses length-normalized log probabilities as implicit rewards — reference-free:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: simpo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  simpo_gamma: 0.5
  cpo_alpha: 1.0
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```

**Rows whose completion trl truncates away are refused.** trl's CPO trainer
truncates each answer to `data.max_length` minus the **longer** answer's length,
so a long `chosen` beside a short `rejected` leaves the short side with zero
trainable tokens — SimPO's length-normalised log-probability is then 0/0, every
adapter tensor trains to NaN, and transformers' nan-inf filter reports the loss
as `0.0`. `soup train` stops before the first step, naming how many rows and
which, with the `data.max_length` involved. Raise `data.max_length`, balance the
pair, or drop the row.


## IPO Training (Regularized Preference)

IPO is a theoretically grounded DPO variant with stronger regularization:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: ipo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  ipo_tau: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```


## RAFT — Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning

When you need a model to *cite* the document it's reading instead of hallucinating, RAFT (Stanford 2024) is the canonical recipe. Each training row carries a query, a golden document, a list of distractor documents, and the answer — the model learns to attend to the relevant doc while ignoring the noise.

```yaml
# soup.yaml
data:
  train: ./data/raft.jsonl
  format: raft

training:
  citation_faithful: true        # enable citation precision/recall scoring
  citation_style: bracket        # cite as [doc-1] inline
```

`training.citation_recall_threshold` is validated but nothing gates a save or a run on it. Setting it warns in v0.76 and is refused as of v0.77 (#761).

```jsonl
# RAFT JSONL row shape
{"query": "When was Python released?", "golden_doc": "Python was released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.", "distractor_docs": ["Ruby was released in 1995.", "Java was released in 1995."], "answer": "1991 [doc-1]"}
```

```bash
# Ready-made 8B Llama recipe
soup recipes show raft-llama3-8b
soup recipes use raft-llama3-8b
```

Citation scoring is exposed as a pure kernel for the eval gate:

```python
from soup_cli.utils.citation_faithful import score_citations

score = score_citations(
    predicted="The answer is 1991 [doc-1].",
    expected_ids=("doc-1",),
)
# CitationScore(precision=1.0, recall=1.0, f1=1.0, predicted_count=1, expected_count=1)
```

Citation-faithful FT is gated to `task in {sft, pretrain}` + `data.format='raft'` — misconfigured runs fail at config load with a named-field message.

Under the hood, a `format: raft` run trains **answer-only**: each row is composed into a prompt (golden + distractor docs, shuffled deterministically by `data.raft_shuffle_seed`, each labelled `[doc-N]`) followed by the answer; the prompt span is masked out of the loss and — when `citation_faithful: true` — the bracketed `[doc-id]` spans in the answer get a boosted per-token loss weight. Rows whose prompt fills `max_length` (answer fully truncated) are dropped with a warning rather than silently shrinking the dataset.

By default the document order is fixed for the whole run. Set `data.raft_epoch_shuffle: true` to **re-permute** the golden + distractor documents *each epoch* (a per-epoch salt folded into the shuffle seed) so the model can't latch onto a fixed citation slot — useful for multi-epoch runs. `epoch=0` reproduces the legacy single-permutation order exactly, so enabling it never changes the first epoch. (v0.71.17)

Score a trained model's citations from the CLI:

```bash
# {predicted, expected_ids} rows, OR RAFT rows scored against their own golden [doc-N]
soup eval citation preds.jsonl --style bracket
# RAFT rows: pass the train-time shuffle seed so the golden id lines up
soup eval citation raft.jsonl --shuffle-seed 0 --output citation.json
```

`soup diagnose` also gains a `citation` failure mode that flags a model that stopped citing the supporting document.


## RA-DIT — Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning

RA-DIT (Meta 2023) is the two-stage version of RAFT: first train a sentence-transformer retriever (contrastive), then fine-tune the generator on the RAFT-style rows. Two recipes ship paired:

```bash
# Stage 1 — train the retriever (uses Soup's v0.16 embedding trainer)
soup recipes use ra-dit-retriever
soup train

# Stage 2 — train the generator on RAFT data, pointing at the retriever
soup recipes use ra-dit-llama3-8b
soup train
```

The schema enforces stage-task pairing — `ra_dit_stage: retriever` requires `task: embedding`; `ra_dit_stage: generator` requires `task: sft`. A misconfigured recipe fails at config load with a named-field message.

Run both stages in one command with `soup ra-dit`:

```bash
soup ra-dit --retriever-config retriever.yaml --generator-config generator.yaml
# preview the plan + the resolved retriever link without training:
soup ra-dit -r retriever.yaml -g generator.yaml --plan-only
```

It trains the retriever, then **records** that trained retriever as the generator's paired retriever (writing its output dir into the generator's `training.ra_dit_retriever_model`) and trains the generator RAFT-style. The recorded retriever is the one used at deploy/serve time — stage-2 does not fuse the retriever weights. A plain `soup train` of a generator-stage config with no retriever model set **auto-links** the most-recent RA-DIT retriever run from the Registry; pass `--retriever-model <m>` to override.


## Curriculum-Aware Training (BETA)

Layer dynamic re-weighting on top of the static `curriculum` bucketer. Every N steps the trainer aggregates per-sample loss + grad-norm into a per-bucket uncertainty signal, runs it through a softmax (temperature-controlled) with floor (water-filling so no bucket drops below `curriculum_dynamic_floor`), and re-weights the sampler. Empty buckets fall back to the median of populated buckets; degenerate inputs return uniform.

```yaml
training:
  curriculum: true                          # static bucketer (v0.23.0)
  curriculum_buckets: 4
  curriculum_metric: perplexity             # length (default) | loss | perplexity
  curriculum_dynamic: true                  # NEW — dynamic re-weighting
  curriculum_dynamic_recompute_steps: 50    # refresh every 50 global steps
  curriculum_dynamic_floor: 0.05            # min weight per bucket
  curriculum_dynamic_temperature: 1.0       # softmax temp on uncertainty
```

**Bucketing by difficulty percentile (v0.71.5).** When `curriculum_metric` is `loss` or `perplexity`, the dynamic callback assigns each step's sample to a bucket by its *rank* within a rolling 512-step window of the difficulty signal (perplexity = `exp(min(loss, 50))`), instead of the round-robin fallback used for `length`. This keeps the buckets calibrated to the live loss distribution rather than a static length sort. `length` (the default) keeps the round-robin assignment.

Visualise the recorded bucket-weight evolution with `soup runs curriculum-curve <run_id>`.

DDP / grad-accum safety: multi-rank launches must wire an `all_reduce` hook on per-bucket stats (a cross-validator rejects un-coordinated multi-rank runs upfront). Multi-trainer expansion beyond `sft` / `pretrain` is tracked for v0.48.1.


## TTS Fine-Tuning (`task='tts'`, BETA, live in v0.71.20)

Live as of v0.71.20 (lifted from the v0.52.0 schema stub). The codec-string
families (`orpheus`, `llasa`, `spark`, `oute`) train with **next-token
cross-entropy over interleaved `[text][audio-codec-token]` chat sequences**,
so `TTSTrainerWrapper` reuses the SFT model/tokenizer/LoRA/CE machinery and
adds per-family emotion templating plus codec-token registration. `sesame_csm`
is different: current CSM training uses text plus 32 Mimi codebooks as parallel
multimodal frames. Soup therefore refuses CSM on this text-SFT codec-string
path rather than silently training the wrong objective; a dedicated CSM trainer
is still required.

There are two workflows:

**Pre-encoded chat (live for codec-string families).** Run the family's audio
codec **offline** so the assistant turn already contains the discrete
codec-token string, then train with `data.format: chatml`. This is plain
cross-entropy and runs on any GPU (validated end-to-end on
SmolLM2-135M-Instruct). This workflow does not turn Sesame CSM's parallel Mimi
codebooks into a valid CSM training example.

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct   # or canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft
task: tts
modality: audio_out
data:
  train: ./data/tts_pre_encoded.jsonl   # assistant turns carry codec tokens
  format: chatml
  new_special_tokens: ["<|codec_0|>", "<|codec_1|>"]   # your codec vocab
training:
  tts_family: orpheus
  tts_emotion: neutral   # Orpheus + Oute only
  lora:
    r: 16
    alpha: 32
```

Operator-supplied `data.new_special_tokens` are registered (deduplicated, only
tokens not already in the vocab) and the embedding matrix is resized through the
(possibly PEFT-wrapped) model so the codec-token ids have rows. Orpheus + Oute
support emotion conditioning via `training.tts_emotion` from a per-family
allowlist (Orpheus: neutral / happy / sad / angry / excited / calm / whisper /
laugh; Oute: neutral / happy / sad / angry / calm / excited) — the wrapper
prepends the family's emotion control string to the first user turn.

**Live-codec (hardware/dependency-gated).** Setting `data.format: audio` asks
the trainer to encode raw audio **at train time**. Orpheus and Llasa are live on
the codec-string path: Orpheus uses `pip install snac` at 24 kHz; Llasa uses
Soup's `[audio]` extra (torchaudio + soundfile). Torchaudio must match the
installed Torch release — recent torchaudio metadata may not make pip enforce
that pairing — then Soup resamples to 16 kHz and calls the
Transformers-native `HKUSTAudio/xcodec2-hf` codec, and
renders the resulting ids as `<|s_ID|>` between Llasa's speech-generation
boundary tokens. Audio remains duration/byte-capped and is read through an
`O_NOFOLLOW` fd. Spark and Oute raw-audio live encoding now fails closed:
Spark-TTS has no installable `sparktts` package and its official environment pins
Torch/Transformers below Soup's supported stack; current `outetts` pins
Transformers 4.52.3 and Oute preparation also needs transcript/word alignment.
For those two families, pre-encode in the upstream environment and train the
resulting codec-token chat with `data.format: chatml`. Sesame CSM fails earlier
with an architecture-specific message because
its 32 parallel Mimi codebooks require a native multimodal trainer, not a
codec-string adapter.

Three ready-made codec-string recipes ship: `orpheus-tts-sft`, `llasa-tts`,
`oute-tts` — copy with `soup recipes use <name>`. Cross-validators
reject the `mlx` backend, `modality != audio_out`, and emotion tags outside the
per-family allowlist.


## Classifier / Reranker / Cross-Encoder Training (BETA, v0.52.0)

Three new task types build on the existing embedding trainer: `task: classifier` (single-label or multi-label sequence classification), `task: reranker` (pointwise retrieval scoring), `task: cross_encoder` (paired-input scoring). Schema-only; live trainer wrapper in v0.52.1.

```yaml
base: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
task: classifier
data:
  train: ./data/classification.jsonl
training:
  num_labels: 3
  classifier_kind: single_label
  label_names: [negative, neutral, positive]
```

`num_labels` is bounded `[1, 1024]` with explicit bool-before-int rejection; `label_names` (optional) must be unique, ≤128 chars each, and match `num_labels` in length when set.


## Knowledge Distillation (BETA, v0.52.0)

New `task: distill` with `training.teacher_model` (HF id or local path), `training.distill_divergence` (`kl` / `forward_kl` / `reverse_kl` / `js` — `kl` canonicalises to `forward_kl`), and `training.distill_temperature` (bounded `[0.05, 100.0]`, finite-only). Schema-only; live loop in v0.52.1.

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B
task: distill
data:
  train: ./data/distill.jsonl
training:
  teacher_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
  distill_divergence: forward_kl
  distill_temperature: 2.0
```

The cross-validator rejects `task='distill'` without `teacher_model`, and rejects `teacher_model` / `distill_*` fields when `task` is anything other than `distill`. It also refuses `task='distill'` on `backend: mlx` and `backend: unsloth` at config load; distillation runs on `backend: transformers` only.


## EBFT + GDPO (BETA, v0.52.0)

Both fields are refused at config load. `training.gdpo_variant` silently did
nothing on supported TRL versions because the DPO loss hook no longer exists
([#1309](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/1309)); remove it and use
plain DPO for `standard`, or SimPO as the nearest (not identical) objective for
`length_normalized`. `margin` has no equivalent. Energy-Based Fine-Tuning
(`training.ebft_variant` + `training.ebft_temperature`) remains refused
([#1230](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/1230)): its term had no
causal shift, so it rewarded copying the input, and shifted it would duplicate
the cross-entropy. See [EBFT / GDPO Loss Variants](#ebft--gdpo-loss-variants).


## gpt-oss `reasoning_effort` + `train_on_eot` (v0.52.0)

`training.reasoning_effort: low | medium | high` injects a system-prefix token at training time for gpt-oss models; `training.train_on_eot: true` includes explicit EOT/EOS control tokens in the SFT loss (axolotl `train_on_eot`). Both are gated to the SFT-family task set (`sft` / `pretrain` / `distill` / `classifier` / `reranker` / `cross_encoder`) — setting them on DPO / GRPO / PPO / etc. fails at config load. Live formatter wiring in v0.52.1.


## MoLE — Per-Token Adapter Routing (`task='moe_lora_routing'`)

Train a small **gating network** that routes each token to a weighted blend of N frozen task
LoRAs (Mixture of LoRA Experts, Wu et al. 2024). The base model and every task adapter stay
frozen — only the router learns which adapter(s) each token should use.

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: moe_lora_routing
modality: text
backend: transformers

data:
  train: ./data/chat.jsonl
  max_length: 512

training:
  mole_task_adapters:        # 2-64 LoRA adapter paths (HF ids or local dirs)
    - ./adapters/math
    - ./adapters/code
    - ./adapters/chat
  mole_top_k: 2              # 1 <= top_k <= len(mole_task_adapters)
  mole_temperature: 1.0      # [1e-6, 100.0]
  epochs: 1
```

The gate is the only trainable parameter; it is saved as `mole_gate.pt` alongside the run, saved into every `checkpoint-N`, and restored by `--resume`.
It trains as an fp32 master weight on every device, so its gradient and AdamW moments are
fp32 too, even where the frozen base loads in bf16 (on CUDA), and `mole_gate.pt` is saved in
fp32: a `Linear(hidden, N)` of `4 x hidden x N` bytes, about 7 KB for the example above and
2 MiB at hidden 8192 with 64 adapters. A bf16 gate with no fp32 copy would round most AdamW
steps away at the default `lr` (#1266).
`compute_loss` runs N+1 forwards per step (base + each adapter under `torch.no_grad()`, blended
by the per-token gate weights) so step time scales with the number of task adapters. To serve
the trained router, see `soup serve --mole` in [Serving and Export](serving-and-export.md).
(v0.71.12)


## Architecture Knobs — Mixture-of-Depths, LLaMA Pro, LongLoRA

Two architecture transforms that were schema-only are now live for SFT / Pretrain on
Llama / Qwen / Mistral. Both apply at trainer setup:

```yaml
training:
  # Mixture-of-Depths (arXiv 2404.02258): route only the top-k tokens through each
  # block. capacity_factor is the fraction of tokens that get the residual update.
  use_mod: true
  mod_capacity_factor: 0.125

  # LLaMA Pro: append zero-initialised identity decoder blocks and train only the new
  # ones (freeze_trainable_layers must equal expand_layers and freezes the
  # originals). Needs quantization: none.
  expand_layers: 4
  freeze_trainable_layers: 4
```

`use_mod` / `expand_layers` attach AFTER `get_peft_model` so the new routers / blocks are
trainable. Unsupported architectures warn + skip. Pick one of MoD / LLaMA Pro per run. (v0.71.12)

LongLoRA S² (`use_longlora: true`) is refused at config load
([#1240](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/issues/1240)). Its override rolled the
query/key projections of half the heads with wrap-around under full causal attention, so
earlier positions saw the last tokens of the sequence, and it applied no grouped attention.
To extend the context, use `rope_scaling_type` with plain LoRA; see
[Long Context](peft-and-efficiency.md#long-context--yarn-llama-31-ntk-longlora).


## Spectrum — Targeted Training on Layer SNR (`soup spectrum scan`, v0.71.23)

Spectrum (arXiv:2406.06623) fine-tunes only the layers with the most signal. `soup spectrum scan`
streams a model's `.safetensors` shards **one tensor at a time** — there is no model load, so it
runs on a CPU box even for very large models — and computes a singular-value signal-to-noise ratio
per weight matrix with a Marchenko-Pastur noise threshold. It ranks the layers within each
module-type group and prints the top `--top-percent` as a ready-to-paste config block:

```bash
soup spectrum scan --model HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M --top-percent 25 --modules mlp,attn -o patch.yaml
```

```yaml
# patch.yaml — paste into your soup.yaml
training:
  unfrozen_parameters:
  - model.layers.0.mlp.down_proj
  - model.layers.29.self_attn.v_proj
  # ...
```

Then train with the patch — the SFT trainer freezes **every** parameter and unfreezes only the
matched set (full fine-tuning, LoRA off):

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: sft
training:
  quantization: none        # Spectrum trains float weights — quantization off
  unfrozen_parameters:
  - model.layers.0.mlp.down_proj
  - model.layers.29.self_attn.v_proj
```

`unfrozen_parameters` entries are regex patterns matched against parameter names. It requires
`task: sft`, `backend: transformers`, `modality: text`, and `quantization: none`, and is mutually
exclusive with LoRA features (`use_dora` / `use_vera` / `moe_lora` / `relora_steps` / …) and the
other freezing knobs (`freeze_layers` / `freeze_ratio` / `train_router_only` / `expand_layers`) —
a conflicting combo is rejected loudly at config load. Scans cache under `~/.soup/spectrum/`
(override with `SOUP_SPECTRUM_CACHE_DIR`); `--no-cache` skips it. `--modules mlp,attn` (vs the
`all` default) is recommended for very large models — it skips the giant embedding/lm_head matrices.
The SNR kernel is pure-numpy and transpose-invariant, so GPT-2 `Conv1D` weights score the same as
Linear weights. (v0.71.23)
